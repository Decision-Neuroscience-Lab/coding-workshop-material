# Decision Neuroscience Lab Coding Practices Workshop

This workshop is focused on establishing good practices in the lab relating to how we write, share and evaluate code. Some useful pieces of software are also introduced to make it easier to find bugs and manage your code. Collaborative programming and writing practices are also described, which may be useful when working with overseas collaborators or on team-based projects.
