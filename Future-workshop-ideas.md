# Future workshop ideas

1. Writing using Markdown and R
2. Tools for debugging your code (automated procedures, input/output checking, using simulated data to test your analysis scripts, trying to crash your code whenever something isn't quite right). 
3. Introduction to R/modelling in R
4. Hackathon to better understand Git, including code reviews
5. TBA depending on feedback after initial workshop
