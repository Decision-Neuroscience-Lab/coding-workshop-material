### Purpose and examples of clear/unclear code ###

Purposes:

- Clean code is easy to read

- Makes it easier to pass your project on to the next person

- Easier for yourself/others to spot an error, and debug it early.

- Allows for easier collaboration,less confusion among teammates.

Example of unclear code:

Example of clear code:


### Advice on writing and formatting MATLAB code ###

- Use long variable names with underscores (HELLO_DECISION_NEUROSCIENCE_LAB) to avoid lengthy documentation.
It is also easier for others to understand your variables and functions.

- Make good use of comments, but avoid super-obvious ones.

- Adopt a guideline for variable usage and commenting style.

- It's nice to line up equal signs, spaces, and commas; this helps a lot with spotting errors.

- Have consistent indentation and styling. Styling is a personal preference, but keeping the styling consistent
makes it easier to read.

- Keep functions small! They can be reused for other functions. It also helps make it easier to read.

- If possible, try to keep lines short by using ellipsis (...)

- Large indents can help late at night when those 2-space indents are hard to see.
