### Purpose and examples of clear/unclear code ###


### Advice on writing and formatting MATLAB code ###

- Use long variable names with underscores (HELLO_DECISION_NEUROSCIENCE_LAB) to avoid lengthy documentation.
It is also easier for others to understand your variables and functions.

- Make good use of comments, but avoid super-obvious ones.

- Have consistent indentation and styling. Styling is a personal preference, but keeping the styling consistent
makes it easier to read!

- Keep functions small! They can be reused for other functions. It also helps make it easier to read.

- Large indents can help late at night when those 2-space indents are hard to see.
