## Introduction to Git
This section of the workshop provides a quick tutorial to Git, open source collaboration and version control.

### Introduction to Git

Some resources:

[Getting started/hello world activity](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

[Github guides and tutorials](https://guides.github.com/)

[Video on using Git commands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)

Here are some guides that show how using Git can be a powerful way to collaboratively develop code:

[Github introduction to flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

[Github comparing workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows)

Here is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) showing how you can also copy entire repositories to your own account, for when you want to make your own versions of experiments or analysis code.

When first using Git I would recommend making some test repositories (see the ‘hello world’ tutorial above) and playing around with different commands to see what they do. This might be easier once you install a Git program on your computer (see step 4).

Also, Github offers [free private repositories](https://education.github.com/pack) for all students, so that you can upload your own code and protect it from prying eyes.


### Setting up a Git account

Create a Github account. This will allow you to be added to the Decision Neuroscience Lab group and contribute to code for experiments and analyses. You can do this at [github.com](https://github.com).


### Joining the Decision Neuroscience Lab organisation

Get added to a team in the Decision Neuroscience Lab organisation. This is an account which hosts code for completed and in-progress projects. Ask Daniel F or Will and they will add you to the organisation. The organisation Github page can be found [here](https://github.com/Decision-Neuroscience-Lab).

### Download and install an application that interfaces with Git

Download and install an application that interfaces with Git. Which program you use depends on your personal preferences. Some popular programs are [SourceTree](www.sourcetreeapp.com/) and [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) (but please send me recommendations of other good alternatives). For this project I would recommend SourceTree as it is relatively easy to learn.

A tutorial for SourceTree can be found [here](https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite/wiki/Getting-started-with-SourceTree,-Git-and-git-flow).


### Useful features of Git (e.g. push, pull, branch) demonstrated in Sourcetree

Most of SourceTree's main working functions can be found in the toolbar, at the top of the interface.
