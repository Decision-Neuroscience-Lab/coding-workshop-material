# Introduction to Markdown and Pandoc #

This section of the workshop introduces Markdown (a simple programming language designed for easy formatting of documents) and Pandoc (a program that allows easy conversion between document types). You can use Markdown and Pandoc to collaboratively write documents and track text modifications. You can even have multiple authors writing different sections of a document at once.

## Writing as coding (introduction to Markdown) ##

There is a great [tutoria](www.markdowntutorial.com) for learning markdown, as well as a [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in case you forget how to format something.
